What is Skrit?
--------------

Skrit is a game framework for JavaScript that tries to get out of your way as
must as possible.
Drawing inspiration from projects like Sinatra, Camping, and React, it tries to
be minimal and intuitive.
A large design goal of Skrit is to be as discoverable as possible.
Inserting a `debugger` and inspecting the data available to you at any time
should provide you with the insight you need to get things done.
Performance, which a concern, is not a primary goal of Skrit and in design
decisions trading off performance and intuitiveness intuitiveness will be the
victor.
